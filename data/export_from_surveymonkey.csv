Four years ago while my father-in-law was dying I dropped back to .8. Despite the cause there was an explosion of creativity in my work.    I noticed that when I had spare time I redesigned tasks, added new and different ITC sparkles, and generally found myself more passionate and enthused about my profession. I engaged with other teachers in different faculties and note that the year 8 students I taught in that year, who are now year 12s, have a closer and friendlier relationship with me than those from other years. As witnessed by the fact that a higher proportion of those I don't teach still seek me out to tell me of their successes and ask for help with work.    The second strand to the problem is that creativity is notoriously difficult to assess. The AC has I think tried to embed it within phrases like ""Ability to effectively combine ideas, images and language from other texts to express ideas differently."" However, ""effectively"" is not the same as ""creatively."" Since there is no explicit learning objective, it follows that it is not always as valued as it should be.  ",Time,Curriculum,,,,,,,,,No,I have attended many to develop my own creativity. There is an obvious transfer of skills and techniques.,"Encouraging opportunities for groups of teachers to share their ideas in a social atmosphere, with games and a clear spirit of ""what if,  give it a go"" or even ñfunî will do MUCH more for fostering creativity than rigidly prescriptive programs.   Despite the professions tendency to attract ""controlaholics"" as a group we don't like being compelled to do things. Part of the problem with the present drive to compel professional development and to regiment it is that what was fun is now a tedious chore. The need to meet and document certain standards encourages a mono-faculty attitude to T & D.  "

I have students who doodle all lesson - that is creative - but they are supposed to be doing something else.  Creativity is over-rated.  You first need knowledge otherwise you are just playing.  Anyone who holds a degree in a creative field - and not just a doodler - will probably confirm this.  Sounds a bit snobby but there it is. Creativity is born out of hard work and practice but not everyone is capable of successfully developing it - most are able to play though and the two are different things.
